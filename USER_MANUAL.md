User Manual: SecureSend
1. Introduction
Welcome to the user manual for the AITeam Final Project: SecureSend. This document serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding, interacting with, and utilizing our project's prototype and associated functionalities. Our project aims to provide a secure and efficient way for clients of a logistics company to track deliveries, manage payments, and get real-time updates through a mobile payment app and a responsive website. We've designed it with user-friendliness in mind, and this manual will walk you through its key aspects.

2. Usage Instructions
Our project's interactive prototype was developed using Figma. Below, you'll find detailed instructions on how to access, navigate, and make the most of our prototype.

2.1 Accessing the Prototype
To begin, please click on the following link to access the live interactive prototype:

(Example: https://www.figma.com/proto/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/YOUR_PROJECT_NAME?node-id=1%3A2&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2)

2.2 Navigating the Interface
Once the prototype loads, you can interact with it as follows:

Clickable Elements: Look for highlighted areas or elements that change upon hover. These are typically buttons, links, or interactive components.

Scrolling: If the content extends beyond the screen, use your mouse scroll wheel or trackpad to scroll up and down.

Back Button: Most prototype tools have a built-in "back" function (often in the browser or the prototype's interface) to return to previous screens.

Logging In: Navigate to the login screen and interact with the input fields to simulate logging in.

Booking a Delivery: Follow the steps to initiate and book a new delivery.

Making a Payment: Proceed through the payment flow, selecting payment options and confirming transactions.

Viewing Order Confirmation/Receipt: Locate and view the details of your completed orders or receipts.

2.3 Key Features and Functionality
Here's an overview of the primary features demonstrated in our prototype:

Delivery Tracking: Allows clients to monitor the real-time status and location of their shipments.

Payment Management: Enables secure and efficient online payment for logistics services.

Real-time Updates: Provides instant notifications and status changes regarding deliveries and payments.

Order Confirmation & Receipts: Displays clear summaries and digital receipts for all transactions.

3. Other Relevant Information
3.1 Project Scope
This prototype represents a full-featured simulation of a mobile payment app and responsive website. It focuses on demonstrating the core user flows of logging in, booking a delivery, choosing payment methods, and receiving order confirmation. While comprehensive, it may not include all edge cases or advanced features of a final, deployed product.

3.2 Technical Considerations
Our design approach prioritized user experience and accessibility. Key considerations include:

Responsive Design: The prototype is designed to adapt seamlessly across both mobile and desktop platforms.

High Color Contrast: Ensured for buttons and text to improve readability and accessibility.

Alt Text: Included for icons and images to provide context for visually impaired users.

Scalable Fonts: Fonts are designed to scale appropriately across different screen sizes.

Keyboard Navigability: Menus and interactive elements are designed to be navigable using a keyboard for enhanced accessibility.

3.3 Future Enhancements
We envision future enhancements to include:

Adding more advanced delivery tracking features (e.g., detailed route maps, estimated time of arrival).

Improving the analytics dashboard for clients to gain deeper insights into their logistics activities.

Conducting another round of usability testing to gather further user feedback and refine the experience.
